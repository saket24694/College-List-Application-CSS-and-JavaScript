## About Project:

AppComponent is parent component and CardComponent is child component. <br />

Infinite scrolling is achieved with Loading time - 2.5 seconds.<br/>

Comments are added in code for better understanding.

## Designs:

Designs are strictly from Zeplin. Only CSS is used to achieve designs. <br />

Project is not Responsive yet.<br />

Please set the screen size to 1440px for best view.<br />

Global CSS can be found in App.css and Component level CSS is in card.css.<br/>

## Functionality:

Functionality is working as per the requirement.<br/>

Scroll: 10 colleges are initially displayed and once scrolled <br/>

to the last college, next 10 colleges are appended and so on until <br/>

the whole JSON gets parsed.<br/>

Loading time is set for 2.5 seconds just to see the effect. We can change Loading time as per our convenience.

## Github Approach:

dev branch is created from Master branch. Seperate branches are created from dev branch for specific features. 

## Installation

Run `npm install`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
